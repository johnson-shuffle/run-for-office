## Overview

> Run For Office aims to have data about all elected offices. We began with the United States and we aim to release data for all elected positions across the country in advance of the upcoming 2020 electionsâ€”putting candidacy information at the fingertips of 120 million people.

Currently, the code in this repository relates to the collection of this information for the following states:

- Louisiana

- Washington
